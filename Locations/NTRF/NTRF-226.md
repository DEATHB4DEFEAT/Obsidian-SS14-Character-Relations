# NTRF-226

## Description

NTRF-226 is, as the name would suggest, the 226th NanoTrasen Research Facility.
This place is significant because [[Cryen]] [[Maya]] created [[Kiera]] [[Philips]] as one of their many intelligent humanoid slime-creature tests and ended up being their most successful result.
