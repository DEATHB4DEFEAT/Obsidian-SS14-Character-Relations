# NTRF-54

## Description

One of the first of many NanoTrasen Research Facilities dedicated to researching Shadowkin.
This place is significant because it is the death location of [[Interest]] and many other [[Shadowkin]] due to their primary organs being overloaded ([[Shadowkin Core Overload]]) causing a rapid and painful yet clean death for the bearer.
