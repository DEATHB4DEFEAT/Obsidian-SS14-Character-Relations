## Description

Meet Klonbei Kiki, or simply Kiki to be informal.
Kiki is remarkably friendly and accepting, with a kind-hearted nature hopefully observed by everyone he encounters.
He loves to help others, prioritizing their needs above his own wherever possible.

Kiki was born without eyes, and often wears a blindfold to cover up the weird appearance and emphasize his blindness.
This has not stopped him from learning the station's layout and memorizing the location of various items.
He can often be seen moving around the station with confidence, using his other senses to assist navigation.

Kiki occasionally goes catatonic during short periods of contemplation and will not pay any attention to the surrounding area.
He possesses a wealth of information, having thoroughly studied and memorized the station's legal documents and guidelines.
His vast knowledge allows him to proficiently perform various tasks and readily offer guidance to those in need.

Kiki's behavior can become monotonous when he isn't actively engaging with others, showing little emotion.
This subtle change often occurs when he believes he is alone.
However, when interacting with others or expressing kindness, his speech and actions come life with warmth and enthusiasm.

One of Kiki's more interesting traits is his ability to form close relationships and trust others easily, as long as the other wants to.
While he avoids unnecessary conflicts, Kiki will actively participate in disputes that directly involve him or seem to be straightforward, always aiming for a peaceful resolution
